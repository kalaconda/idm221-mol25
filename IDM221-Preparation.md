#IDM221
<!-- This is the IDM221 - Preparation Assignment -->
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<h3> My name is Mikayla, i'm from Trevose, PA, and i'm a first-year transfer student at Drexel. 
<br></br>
Before transfering, I completed two years at BCCC  as a <i>Multimedia</i> major, also known as <i>Interactive Digital Media.</i> I've always had an interest in working with various forms of media which is why I took an interest in IDM. Some of my day to day hobbies consist of working with programs for video editing, animation, game design, & graphic design.
<br></br>
<h2> Content Preparation</h2>
<h3> Three websites that I draw inspiration from are 
[https://www.apple.com/](https://www.apple.com/), [https://www.adobe.com/](https://www.adobe.com/), [https://crunchyroll.com/](https://www.crunchy.com/)
<br></br>
Out of all three websites, I like Apple's website's user interface the most because it has a clean layout and its style relates to the products Apple markets. One component that I like about Apple's website unlike Adobe or Crunchyroll is that they include their all the possible features their company offers threw the website.
